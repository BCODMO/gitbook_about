BCO-DMO relies on highly trained staff who possess formal domain science training, hands-on field experience, and data management expertise, making them familiar with many of the curated data types.

BCO-DMO Staff work collaboratively with submitters to process and share their project output, making them FAIR (Finable, Accessible, Reusable, Interoperable) and ready for reuse. Project administration is performed by the four Principal Investigators, advised by a Strategic Planning Committee to provide feedback from a science end-user perspective.

**Please contact** [**info@bco-dmo.org**](https://emailto:info@bco-dmo.org) **if you have any questions or comments about the BCO-DMO initiative or would like to discuss the publication of data or results from your project.** You can expect to receive a reply within 48 hours. If you are having difficulties with email, you can contact one of our Data Managers listed below.
