# Privacy

### Information we collect&#x20;

#### Information provided directly

By way of scientific data curation, BCO-DMO collects and retains a limited amount of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) about the data contributors and submitters. This type of information may include an individual's given and surname, aliases or nicknames, affiliation name and address, email address, work phone number, and a persistent identifier such as an Open Research and Contributor Identifier (ORCiD number). This information is provided to BCO-DMO by the submitter upon completion of the data submission process.&#x20;

#### Information collected via automated technology (Website usage)

We use automated technologies, such as cookies and similar tracking tools, on our website. When you log in using ORCiD OAuth, we collect and store a personal access token to authenticate your identity securely. This allows us to verify your credentials without requiring repeated logins.

Additionally, we use Google Analytics to gather insights into how visitors interact with our website. This includes data such as page views, traffic sources, and user behavior patterns. The information collected is anonymized and used for analytical purposes.

You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. However, disabling certain cookies may affect site performance or limit access to specific features.

### Use of Information

Submitter PII is included in data package metadata to provide context, a means of contact for specific issues relating to the respective dataset, and a means of attribution via data citation.

Identity and contact information are used by BCO-DMO staff to correspond with relevant data submitters and/or contributors during data processing and publication (e.g., to obtain additional information, final review, and approval).

BCO-DMO does not use submitter and contributor PII for solicitation or blanket communication such as mass emailing or newsletters, and does not provide its stakeholder PII to third-party organizations.&#x20;

### Security

The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your personal data are important. We store most information about you in computer systems and databases operated by us, our Institution (WHOI), or our service providers. We implement and regularly review technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal data stored in our systems from unauthorized access, misuse, or modification. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
